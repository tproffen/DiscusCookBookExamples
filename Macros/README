Macros
------

This folder contains all macro files shown in the book. They are organized by chapter 
and the path to the file is shown in the book with each macro (e.g. sim/simul.1.mac).
Note that there might be cases where the macro needs a structure file loaded which 
woul be mentioned in the book. The macros will usually assume that you are in the
DISCUS section when running them.

The file run_all.mac will run all macros in this folder and is primarily used for
testing.
